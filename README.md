<p align="center"><h1>ðŸ§  ChatGPT Prompts applied to Geomatics</h1></p>

Welcome to the ChatGPT Prompts applied to Geomatics" repository! This is a collection of prompt examples to be used with the ChatGPT model for geomatics applications.

The [ChatGPT](https://chat.openai.com/chat) model is a large language model trained by [OpenAI](https://openai.com) that is capable of generating human-like text. By providing it with a prompt, it can generate responses.

In this repository, you will find a variety of prompts that can be used with ChatGPT for various geomatics applications. We encourage you to [add your own prompts](https://github.com/f/chatgpt-prompts-geomatics/edit/main/README.md) to the list, and to use ChatGPT to generate new prompts as well.

To get started, simply clone this repository and use the prompts in the README.md file as input for ChatGPT. You can also use the prompts in this file as inspiration for creating your own.

We hope you find these prompts useful and have fun using ChatGPT!
